# Multithread Bitcoin Brute Force for P2PKH or legacy address

This is a Node.js script that uses multiple worker processes to generate random private keys for Bitcoin P2PKH or legacy wallets in hexadecimal format and check if they match any of the P2PKH or legacy addresses in a file named `data.txt`. If a match is found,  the script saves the wallet and its private key (seed) in WIF format to a file named ‘match.txt’ and quits program.

## For people without technical experience you can buy the compiled application for windows from here:

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1. Add the Bitcoin addresses you want to check against to a file named `data.txt`, with one address per line (Addresses must start with 1).
2. Run `node app.js` to start the script.
3. The script will display the loop count for each worker process in real-time.
4. If a match is found, the wallet address and its private key will be saved to a file named `match.txt` and the script will exit.
